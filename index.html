              Valorant is a team-based multiplayer first-person shooter game that was developed and published by Riot Games. The game is set in a near-future world and features a diverse cast of agents, each with their own unique abilities and skills.
              <br>
              <br>
              Players can choose from a variety of agents, each with a distinct playstyle and set of abilities. Some agents are focused on dealing damage and taking out opponents, while others are more focused on supporting their team with abilities like healing or creating obstacles to impede enemy movement. Each agent's abilities complement their playstyle and can be used to gain an advantage over the opposing team.
              <br>
              <br>
              In addition to the agent abilities, players can purchase weapons and equipment before each round with in-game currency earned from previous rounds. This includes pistols, rifles, and sniper rifles, as well as armor, grenades, and other useful items. The right combination of agents, weapons, and equipment can be the key to winning a match.
              <br>

            <h3>Viper is the best agent on Valorant!</h3>
            <p class="section__description--para">
              Viper has the ability to create poison clouds, toxic screens, and a poison pit that can be used to block off areas and damage enemies that walk through them. This can be extremely useful in preventing enemies from pushing certain areas, forcing them to take alternative routes, or simply delaying their progress.
            </p>
            <p class="section__description--para">
              Viper's abilities can be used in a variety of ways, such as using the poison cloud to obscure vision or dealing damage, the snakebite to damage enemies or block off areas, and the toxic screen to create cover or cut off sightlines. This makes her a flexible agent that can adapt to different situations.
            </p>
            <p class="section__description--para">
              Viper's abilities can also be used to gather information about enemy movements, as the poison cloud and toxic screen can reveal the location of enemies that pass through them.
            </p>
            <p class="section__description--para">
              Viper's ultimate ability, Viper's Pit, creates a large cloud of poison that deals damage to enemies and significantly reduces their visibility. This can be an extremely powerful tool for holding a site, retaking a site, or simply preventing the enemy team from advancing.
